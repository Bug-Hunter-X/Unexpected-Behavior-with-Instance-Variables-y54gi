# Ruby Instance Variable Access
This example demonstrates a potential issue in Ruby related to accessing instance variables outside of the class definition.

## The Problem
Directly accessing instance variables from outside a class can lead to errors or unexpected behavior.

## The Solution
Use accessor methods to access instance variables to ensure encapsulation and maintain code consistency. The solution file shows how to correct this using getter method.
